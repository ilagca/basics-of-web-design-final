     <h4 style="color: rgb(110, 39, 39)">The bolero dance
        genre is an American style ballroom dance. It has early roots in the 18th century in Spain and Cuba, both evolving into different dance forms. However, it is uncertain which form was most influential in the current ballroom bolero dance. While in its early history it was danced by a female solo, today it is a social partner and dancesport dance genre. Moreover, the Cuban form traveled from Cuba to Mexico, Latin America. Eventually, it arrived in the United States in the mid-1930â€™s. In addition, the bolero is sometime referred to as rumba bolero but is, in fact, the precursor of the ballroom rumba. Furthermore, It is usually danced to the slowest tempo rumba music rhythms, anywhere from 96 to 120 beats per minute.
