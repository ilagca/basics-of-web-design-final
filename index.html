                                The words "dance" and "dancing" come from an old German word "danson," which means "to
                                stretch." All dancing is made up of stretching and relaxing. The muscles are tensed for
                                leaping and then relaxed as we make what we hope will be a gentle and graceful landing.
                                Dancing must be organized; it is not enough to jump around the floor with anger or
                                excitement. Dancing is a way of expressing one's emotions through a succession of
                                movements disciplined by rhythm.
