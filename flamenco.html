       <h4>Flamenco is the traditional song and dance of the Gypsies (flamencos) of Andalucia. Its evolution is a source of great debate with no accepted explanation of how flamenco resulted from the cultural influences of such diverse regions as North Africa, Southern Europe and the Near and Far East. Flamenco has never been more popular in Spain and abroad than it is today with a new generation of flamenco performers in the post-Franco era who have broadened flamencoâ€™s appeal to an international audience.
