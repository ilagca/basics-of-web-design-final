  <h4 style="color:rgb(15, 133, 133) ;">The original form of Waltz was first used by 13th century peasants in Germany, who devised rolling folk dance that was quite different from all court dances that were popular in that time. Their folk dance filled with rolls, glides and turns was received well, and by 1500s it reached Volta where it was adapted with styles of other local dances. By the end of 16th century people of Vienna embraced Waltz and morphed it into dance called Weller, and France used form called Nizzarda.</H4>  <br/>
