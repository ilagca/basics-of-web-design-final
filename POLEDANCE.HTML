 <h4>Pole dance, also known as pole dance, is a performance art performed around a vertical pole by combining dance and acrobatics. It has started to become widespread as an alternative fitness branch since the mid-2000s. In this period, pole professionals and amateurs began to emphasize the acrobatic side of pole dance in order to eliminate negative connotations all over the world, and this approached the circus performance of the dance called the Chinese pole.
